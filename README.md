# Matlab-implementation-video-signal
The objective of this practical work is to understand the color format conversion mechanisms to generate
YCbCr from RGB, the different color sampling formats and how they affect the quality of the
reconstructed images. The student would implement in Matlab several functions involved in the
conversion.
The set of files that conform this practical work are:

[2] Different RGB images that will be used to test the different functions involved in the color format
conversion
